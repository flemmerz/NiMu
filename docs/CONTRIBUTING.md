# Contributing to NiMu

We love your input! We want to make contributing to NiMu as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed.
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of other developers.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License
